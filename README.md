# attributionmodeling
Most paths to purchase are not a straight line. There are lots of ways for customers to discover your brand, engage with it, and move further down the sales funnel. Thatâ€™s why attribution models have become a necessary tool for marketers looking for data to improve their campaigns.   Attribution modeling is a strategy that allows marketers to analyze and assign credit to marketing touchpoints that occur at the specific steps of the customer journey, from searching for a product online to making a purchase, and every action in between. Using attribution models helps marketers better understand which parts of their marketing efforts are driving the most leads to that part of the sales funnel.   In this project, we try to understand if there is a significant difference in Data of Google Merchandising Store using the Model Comparison Tool of Google Analytics. Here we implement Hypothesis Testing - ANOVA by comparing various models across a single channel. If there is a presence of Significant Difference after ANOVA implementation we then perform Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) Test to understand exactly which means are different i.e. because of which Attribution Models it delivers the Significant Difference. The result of our analysis would be to deliver if there is any presence of Statistical Significance in Google Merchandising Store Attribution Modelling Data.
